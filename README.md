## Project Synopsis

### Problem  
Many people struggle with mental health but avoid speaking up because of stigma, fear of judgment, and lack of privacy. Online platforms that offer support are often unsafe and full of fake users or bots, which makes it even harder for people to feel comfortable opening up.

### Solution  
**SpeakUp** is a simple and safe chat platform where people can join anonymous support rooms to talk about their feelings and connect with others who understand. Users log in using their **Fayda digital ID**, which confirms they are real people without revealing their personal identity.

### Extended Support from Professionals  
To enhance the quality of conversations, **SpeakUp includes licensed psychiatrists who participate in the platform just like other users** — joining chat rooms, offering insights, and listening with empathy. They do **not lead or dominate the conversations**, but rather **blend into the community** and provide supportive, professional input when appropriate.

These professionals are **clearly verified (e.g., with a special badge)** so that users can recognize them if they want to reach out. This design helps keep the space informal and welcoming, while still making professional help easily accessible and stigma-free.

Additionally, **psychiatrists may offer scheduled private sessions or guided discussions** around specific mental health topics — all within the secure and verified ecosystem of SpeakUp.

### Expected Outcome  
We want to create a trusted, judgment-free space for mental health support where only verified users can join. This will encourage open conversations and build a caring online community where people feel safe and supported — with the added benefit of **professional mental health support** when needed.

### Fayda’s Role  
Fayda provides a secure login system. It helps us ensure that users are real people, while keeping their names and other personal information private. This prevents bots, fake users, and trolls from entering the chat and builds trust in the community.

### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript or React  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Authentication**: VeriFayda OIDC (Fayda Login)
