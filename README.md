## Project Synopsis

### Problem  
Many people struggle with mental health but avoid speaking up because of stigma, fear of judgment, and lack of privacy. Online platforms that offer support are often unsafe and full of fake users or bots, which makes it even harder for people to feel comfortable opening up.

### Solution  
**SpeakUp** is a simple and safe chat platform where people can join anonymous support rooms to talk about their feelings and connect with others who understand. Users log in using their **Fayda digital ID**, which confirms they are real people without revealing their personal identity.

### Extended Support from Professionals  
<!--  
This feature is currently under development and will be launched soon after the MVP competition.

We are preparing to integrate **licensed psychiatrists** into SpeakUp. These professionals will begin joining **group chat rooms** alongside regular users to offer guidance and listen without judgment. Their presence will be clearly marked with a **verified badge**, and they’ll be visible to users in the group room participants list.

**Coming soon after MVP launch:**
- **Paid one-on-one sessions**: Users will be able to book private sessions with psychiatrists for personalized support. Sessions will be booked in advance, and payments will be processed through secure gateways.
- **Free support in group chats**: Psychiatrists can offer support inside public chat rooms. This remains free and open to everyone.
- **Rating system**: Users will be able to rate psychiatrists based on the quality of their group support responses.
- **Monthly certification**: Each month, psychiatrists with the highest community rating will receive a **SpeakUp Community Certification**, making their support more recognized and trusted within the platform.

This approach makes **professional help accessible, flexible, and community-driven**, while still keeping the platform welcoming for all.

### Expected Outcome  
We want to create a trusted, judgment-free space for mental health support where only verified users can join. This will encourage open conversations and build a caring online community where people feel safe and supported — with the added benefit of professional guidance when needed.

### Fayda’s Role  
Fayda provides a secure login system. It helps us ensure that users are real people, while keeping their names and other personal information private. This prevents bots, fake users, and trolls from entering the chat and builds trust in the community.

### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript or React  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express  
- **Database**: MySQL or MongoDB
