## Project Synopsis

### Problem  
Many people struggle with mental health but avoid speaking up because of stigma, fear of judgment, and lack of privacy. Online platforms that offer support are often unsafe and full of fake users or bots, which makes it even harder for people to feel comfortable opening up.

### Solution  
**SpeakUp** is a simple and safe chat platform where people can join anonymous support rooms to talk about their feelings and connect with others who understand. Users log in using their **Fayda digital ID**, which confirms they are real people without revealing their personal identity.

### Extended Support from Professionals  
To make the platform even more impactful, we plan to **integrate licensed psychiatrists** who can join specific chat rooms or host private sessions for users who need professional guidance. These experts will be verified and scheduled to be available at certain times, making real help accessible in a supportive, trusted environment.

### Expected Outcome  
We want to create a trusted, judgment-free space for mental health support where only verified users can join. This will encourage open conversations and build a caring online community where people feel safe and supported — with the added benefit of **professional mental health support when needed**.

### Fayda’s Role  
Fayda provides a secure login system. It helps us ensure that users are real people, while keeping their names and other personal information private. This stops bots, fake users, and trolls from entering the chat and builds trust in the community.

### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript or React  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express  
- **Database**: MySQL or MongoDB  
- **Authentication**: VeriFayda OIDC (Fayda Login)
