## Project Synopsis

### Problem
Many people struggle with mental health but avoid speaking up because of stigma, fear of judgment, and lack of privacy. Online platforms that offer support are often unsafe and full of fake users or bots, which makes it even harder for people to feel comfortable opening up.

### Solution
SpeakUp is a simple and safe chat platform where people can join anonymous support rooms to talk about their feelings and connect with others who understand. Users log in using their Fayda digital ID, which confirms they are real people without revealing their personal identity.

### Expected Outcome
We want to create a trusted, judgment-free space for mental health support where only verified users can join. This will encourage open conversations and build a caring online community where people feel safe and supported.

### Fayda’s Role
Fayda provides a secure login system. It helps us make sure that users are real people, while keeping their names and other personal information private. This stops bots, fake users, and trolls from entering the chat.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript or React
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Mysql or MongoDB
- **Authentication**: VeriFayda OIDC (Fayda Login)
