## Real People, Real Support — No Names Needed  
SpeakUp creates a unique balance between **anonymity and trust**. Users log in with their **Fayda digital ID** — proving they're real — but their **personal identity stays private**. This ensures safe, honest conversations without fear of judgment, bots, or trolls.

## Project Synopsis

### Problem  
Many people experience mental health challenges but avoid speaking up because of stigma, fear of judgment, or lack of privacy. Most online platforms feel unsafe, with fake users and bots, making it harder to open up.

### Solution  
**SpeakUp** is a simple and safe chat platform where people can join anonymous support rooms and talk about their feelings with others who truly understand. By using **Fayda digital ID**, users are verified as real people — while remaining completely anonymous to others.

### Target Audience  
SpeakUp is designed for **teens, young adults, and anyone seeking a supportive space** to talk about mental health — especially in **communities where stigma is still strong**.

### Extended Support from Professionals  
<!--  
This feature is currently under development and will be launched soon after the MVP competition.

We plan to integrate **licensed psychiatrists** into SpeakUp this week. These professionals will begin joining **group chat rooms** like any other user — participating in discussions, listening, and sharing supportive advice when needed. Their profiles will display a **verified badge**, and their presence will be visible in chat rooms.

**Coming soon after MVP launch:**
- **Paid one-on-one sessions**: Users will be able to book private sessions with psychiatrists. These sessions will be paid, secure, and easy to access.
- **Free participation in group chats**: Psychiatrists can also participate freely in public chat rooms, helping users in a more casual, open setting.
- **Rating system**: Users can rate psychiatrists based on how helpful their group responses are.
- **Monthly certification**: Psychiatrists with the highest ratings each month will be awarded a **SpeakUp Community Certification** to recognize their impact.

This approach ensures **accessible, trustworthy support**, whether you're chatting with peers or seeking help from a professional.

### Expected Outcome  
We aim to build a **trusted, judgment-free community** where verified users feel safe to express themselves. With both **peer support and optional professional guidance**, SpeakUp empowers people to speak honestly, heal together, and know they are not alone.

### Fayda’s Role  
Fayda provides secure digital ID login. It ensures that users are real people without revealing their names or private data. This protects the community from bots, trolls, and fake accounts, making SpeakUp a safer place to be vulnerable.
